    During GovHack Sydney 2015, 5 strangers came together with only a rough idea, a desire to improve the use of the Australian Governmentâ€™s database and maybe even win a prize or two. Our goal was to simplify how people find charities in Australia and help connect individuals and businesses to local charities within their community.
      The idea behind uSharity initially was to bridge the gap between charities, businesses, and individuals by offering a platform that functioned as an event playing field for charities (regardless of budget or success) and a simplified search for finding organisations by cause, industry, and regions/geo-codes. In the span of a weekend we were able to outline, develop, and launch a working prototype: www.uSharity.org
       After the event, the uSharity Team decided to carry on the project to make it real and social impact to assist more individuals, local communities and charities.
